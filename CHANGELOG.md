# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.3.3]
### Changed
- Bugfix: extra address fields would not show in My Account page during a fresh install.
- Bugfix: create order and reorder from backend now fill in address fields correctly.

## [1.3.2]
### Changed
- Bugfix: Swagger error: invalid parameter type of Paazl Shipping Model Data Delivery
- Fixed compatiblity issue with MultiSafepay. (With help from redelschaap)

## [1.3.1]
### Changed

## [1.3.0] - 2017-08-02
With the 1.3.0 release we're introducing a better way for Paazl to store customer address information in Magento. By default, Magento handles the street information in a single field and uses multiple lines to store the information. This is considered suboptimal as it causes a lot of problems with compatibility. New separate Customer attributes are introduced: street_name, house_number, house_number_addition.

*EE Only: If you're already using custom Customer attributes (e.g. `house number`), make sure it follows Paazl's exact naming convention (they are varchar fields).*

- All UI components that have address fields are replaced with the new customer attributes (frontend / backend).
- All existing addresses are automatically converted to the new format when they are loaded.
- To maintain 100% compatibility, before saving the customer address a new flattened value is stored in the original street attribute.

### Improvements / Bug fixes
A lot of bug fixes and small improvements are included in this release:
- The product matrix is now configurable from A-ZZ instead of A-Z.
- Added option to enable the postcode validation (disabled by default due to UI issues with addresses outside the Netherlands, better UI planned for a future release).
- Checkout field sort order set to: Street Number, House Number, House Number Addition, Postcode, City, State, Country
- Solve issue in the cart where the tax would not be calculated properly because Paazl expects a full address instead of only a postcode. (Reported by ISM e-Company)
- Solve issue in the cart where filling in your state would throw a JS error.
- Solve issue where saving a customer address would throw an exception. CE Only
- Solve issue where a reorder would throw an exception. (Reported by Guapa)
- Solve issue where having a different configuration per website would cause issues (Reported by Guapa).
- House number now has numeric validation on the frontend
- Cron jobs will now keep running when a single order fails to commit to Paazl.
- Cron jobs will now log encountered error codes in the order.
- My Account section translations
- Solve issue where the address couldn't be rendered when using a newly entered address in the checkout when logged-in.
- Solve issue where Street+Housenumber+Addition would be send to Paazl on a single line.
- Solve issue where delivery dates weren't in the proper timezone
- Solve issue where the shipping options were empty because timezone differences.
- Solve issue where the pickup option would always be selected after the delivery type was changed
multiple times in the popup.
- Solve issue where opening the Paazl Perfect popup would reset the country.

### Known Issues / Limitations
- 'Admin Panel Order Create' and 'Frontend multishipping' does not support Paazl Perfect, only basic functionality is supported.
- Core Bug: Customer Address field are not update for order edit address.  (Ticket #03212673)
    - Backend, open order, choose ‘edit’ at billing address. change the house number, field is not updated for the order.
    - If you order as logged-in customer and choose for a different billing address on the payment step then it does not save the house number.
